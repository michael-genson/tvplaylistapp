# TV Playlist App

### Overview
The TV Playlist App is a simple, lightweight application to generate a playlist of episodes with commercials. The idea is to emulate that "Sunday Night TV Marathon" experience.
Credits to Thomas Piltoff who came up with the idea and pitched the requirements. This app would not exist without his help!

### Technical Details
This app uses primarily out-of-the-box python, along with simpletkgui, a pet project of mine to make building simple python UIs quick, easy, and painless. You can check it out here: https://github.com/michael-genson/simpletkgui. The app was built to play nice with VLC, but can be used for any media player that supports the .m3u extension.

### Usage and general information
Check out the included "TV Playlist App Documentation.docx" file for step-by-step usage instructions. If you're compiling your own version of the app, feel free to include the documentation with your release.
